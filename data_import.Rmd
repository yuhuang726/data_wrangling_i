## Read in some data

Read in the litters dataset.
clean_names function is in the package "janitor". Since we did not library it, so we use "janitor::" to get the function. You can also library it at the beginning.
ckean_names: change blank into _ in the columns' names.

```{r}
litters_df = read_csv("data/FAS_litters.csv")
litters_df = janitor::clean_names(litters_df)
```

## Take a look at the data

printing in the console

```{r}
litters_df
```

```{r}
head(litters_df)
tail(litters_df)
```

skim can give you missing value number, min, max, mean, p25, p75, small histogram (but prof dosen't use it frequently, he prefer view).
view will open up a new window to show full dataset. But that will make Knit difficult so usually avoid using it in code chunk in R markdown.

view(litters_df)

```{r}
skimr::skim(litters_df)
```
